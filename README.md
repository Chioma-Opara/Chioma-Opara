- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chioma-Opara
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m broadly interested in Machine Learning. I'm currently working on two main projects. The first is with the Veterinary and Biological Informatics Lab at Smith College where I'm trying to scale down huge genomic data sets to facilitate analysis of the data.
- The overall goal of the project is to investigate whether mice are a good model for studying cancer in humans. My second major project is focused on prompt tuning for Large Language Models. Can we come up with an optimal structure for prompting LLMs in different contexts that is applicable across different models. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building my skills in utilizing git for project development and exploring prompt engineering
