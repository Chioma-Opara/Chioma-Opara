## 🧠 Ongoing & Recent Projects

### 🌍 Equitable AI for Dermatology — *Spring 2025*
Developed a dermatology classification model for the **Break Through Tech x Algorithmic Justice League** Kaggle competition.  
The model classified 21 skin conditions while addressing bias against darker skin tones.

**Key Highlights**:
- Used a **Vision Transformer (ViT Base Patch 16)** with transfer learning
- Integrated **Focal Loss** and **Mixup Augmentation** for fairness and generalization
- Applied a variety of **data augmentation** techniques including CLAHE and noise
- Emphasized explainability using confusion matrix-based visualizations
- Achieved strong results on the **Kaggle leaderboard** using weighted average F1-score
